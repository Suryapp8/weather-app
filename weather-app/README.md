Hello team, I have tried to implement all the functions which were asked to implement in this app byu using ReactJs

For styling the app I have used tailwind. It has fully function search input where user can search for the cities and get the result. Also user can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units. I have also added a feature where user can get the weather information by clicking on the location icon. I have used OpenWeather API to fetch the data. I have also tried to display five day forecast, but the "onecall" feature by open weather api is not working as they have made it paid to access, still I have written code for it. It can be found in "../api/weather".

Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you
